Documentation
--------------------------

Not totally sure what the heck goes in here. This is my attempt to start to learn how to build a website. It's the Phi Psi Cal Mu Alumni Corp Website.

This will be updated as necessary.
Right now I'm not using any external libraries. I've made an attempt to set up Google Analytics but it doesn't seem to be working.
I've only written some CSS and HTML so far.
